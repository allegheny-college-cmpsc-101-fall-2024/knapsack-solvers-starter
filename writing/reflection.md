TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the TODO markers inside of this file and
either remove or rewrite the prompts. When you are finished with this reflection
it should contain professional writing that is suitable for publishing. That
includes removing this paragraph!

## Add Your Name Here

## 1. Program Output

### What is the output from running the following commands?

TODO: Run the program with the command `python demonstrate_knapsack_solvers.py`
TODO: Use a fenced code block to provide output from running the program on
you computer.

## 2. Program Understanding

TODO: Read Guttag Chapter 14. Based on your understanding, answer the questions
below.

- explain how the greedy-by-value algorithm works
- explain how the greedy-by-weight algorithm works
- explain how the greedy-by-density algorithm works
- explain how the exhaustive powerset algorithm works to find the true solution

## 3. Professional Development

TODO: Provide an answer to the questions using your own words. Cite sources as
needed.

- What are some ways in which the use of a knapsack solver connects to other areas
  of computer science?
- What is the general-purpose equation that illustrates the relationship between
  `n`, the number of values in a set and the number of values in the set's
  powerset?
- How many items are inside of the powerset of the list of items in Table 14-1?
  Why?
